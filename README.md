### Nice touches I want to include

- I like the "My Journey" from the Bolt site
- Let's Connect needs to have this "Have a project in mind or want to discuss opportunities? I'd love to hear from you!"
- Clean code but I want to showcase I understand the WHY and HOW to test and write clean code
- A blurb that says "Always learning and exploring new technologies" but this needs to not look like a button!
- The footer of the Bolt site is nice.

### Things I want to change or rethink

- I am not a fan of "Full Stack Developer" and I think it should say more than that
- See what we want to showcase
- Do we need a cool 'icon'?
- What projects are "refined" enough to show up in the projects list?

## Notes

- This is the CloudFront Id: E3IX6EANN4QMLA
- This link is from Bolt.new and is more fleshed out: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb1-taktvuhs?file=index.html
- Loveable is runnable from localhost:8080

## Prompts

- I would like to build a portfolio style website that showcases both my websites and some of the newer REST APIs I have built using new languages I learned.
- Create a stunning portfolio website that showcases both my web projects and REST APIs. This would be the perfect opportunity to create something that really highlights my technical versatility and growth. I'm envisioning a modern, developer-focused portfolio with clean lines and sophisticated typography - drawing inspiration from sites like GitHub's developer showcases and modern SaaS landing pages. We'll use a dark theme with vibrant accent colors to give it that cutting-edge tech feel.
- I've created a stunning, modern portfolio website that perfectly showcases both your web projects and REST APIs! The design features a sophisticated dark theme with purple/pink gradient accents, smooth animations, and a professional developer-focused aesthetic.
