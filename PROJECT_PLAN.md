### Nice touches I want to include

- I like the "My Journey" from the Bolt site
- Let's Connect needs to have this "Have a project in mind or want to discuss opportunities? I'd love to hear from you!"
- Clean code but I want to showcase I understand the WHY and HOW to test and write clean code
- A blurb that says "Always learning and exploring new technologies" but this needs to not look like a button!
- DONE: The footer of the Bolt site is nice.

### Things I want to change or rethink

- I am not a fan of "Full Stack Developer" and I think it should say more than that
- See what we want to showcase
- Do we need a cool 'icon'?
- What projects are "refined" enough to show up in the projects list?
